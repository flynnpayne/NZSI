Assignment for DWEB513 Website Project as part of the Diploma of Website Development and Design at Ara Institute of Canterbury.

For this assignment I had to design and create a website for an imaginary client, I spent 7 weeks gathering the clients needs and designing a suitable website for them. I then had another 7 weeks to build and customise the website using Silverstripe CMS which is hosted on a web server.

Im still waiting for this assignment to be marking.

This was probably my favorite project so far because of the time we had to build it and just the size of the website and work required. There were a few features that I wanted to add but they were out of scope due to a lack of time at the end.
